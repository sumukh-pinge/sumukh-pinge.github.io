This style file formats bibliographies stored in BibTeX files and produced by LaTeX documents. [This bibliography](/d4.pdf) illustrate the output of the style file.

## Download

- [bibliography.bst](/bibliography.bst) -- Style file to format bibliographies produced by LateX documents. Must be included in the same folder as the LaTeX document. The bibliography must be stored in a BibTex document (`.bib` format).

## How to use

- Add `bibliography.bst` to the folder with your LaTeX files.
- Insert `\bibliographystyle{bibliography}` in the preamble of your document to call `bibliography.bst`.
- Insert `\usepackage{natbib}` in the preamble of your document to call the `natbib.sty` package, which is used to cite references and produce the bibliography (this package is part of standard LaTeX distributions).
- Insert `\bibliography{bibliography}` at the end of the document to produce the bibliography. All the references cited in the text must be in a BibTex file `bibliography.bib`. The BibTeX file must be in the same folder as the other LaTeX files.

## Reference

As much as possible the style file follows the guidelines from the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html). The style file is based on the style file `econ.bst`, which was created by [Shiro Takeda](https://shirotakeda.github.io) and is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ShiroTakeda/econ-bst).
