This template produces minimalist academic presentations with LaTeX Beamer. [This newsletter post](https://pmichaillat.substack.com/p/a-minimalist-template-for-academic) explains the design choices made in the template. [This presentation](/d1.pdf) illustrates the output of the template. 

## Download

- [presentation.tex](/presentation.tex) --  Skeleton of the presentation. Fill it out with the content of your presentation. By compiling `presentation.tex` you obtain [this PDF file](/d1.pdf).
- [presentation.sty](/presentation.sty) --  LaTeX style file collecting all the formatting commands. Must be included in the same folder as `presentation.tex`.

## Key features

- The font for text, roman math, and numbers is [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro).
- The font for Greek and calligraphic math is [Euler](http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-26139.html).
- No colors are used in the text (only grayscale) to reduce distraction.
- Colors are reserved for graphs and alerts.
- Margins, spacing, and font size are set for comfortable reading.
- There are no frills at the periphery of the slides.

## Reference

As much as possible the template follows Matthew Butterick's wonderful typographical advice in [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com)â€”especially the [section on presentations](https://practicaltypography.com/presentations.html).
